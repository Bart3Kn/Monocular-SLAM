# Monocular-SLAM
Final Year Project for University

This is my attempt at attempting to implement a ORB based monocular SLAM that is able to take an mp4 file input and create 3D map.


This project utilises the following dependances:

**OpenCV**
`pip install opencv-contrib-python`

**Pangolin**
This is prebuilt in the lib folder.
This utilises the Marko Elez's fork of Pangolin

**Numpy**
`pip install numpy`

**Scikit Image Pagackage**
`python -m pip install -U scikit-image`
